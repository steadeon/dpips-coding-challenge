# Java Coding Challenge

You have received this challenge as part of a recruiting process. The contents of this exercise are confidential, so please do not distribute. Also do not reference "dpips" or anything else that would connect your solution repository to this.

You have 7 days to complete this challenge but it shouldn't take you longer than a few hours. Please send it back as soon as you're done.

## Description

Build a simple social networking application, similar to Twitter, and
expose it through a web API. The application should support the scenarios
below.

## Scenarios

### Posting

A user should be able to post a 140 character message.

### Wall

A user should be able to see a list of the messages they've posted, in reverse
chronological order.

### Following

A user should be able to follow another user. Following doesn't have to be
reciprocal: Alice can follow Bob without Bob having to follow Alice.

### Timeline

A user should be able to see a list of the messages posted by all the people
they follow, in reverse chronological order.

## Details

- Code in Java (Java 7 or 8)
- Use Maven for build (including relevant files in your repo)
- Include anything else in your repo that reflects good software engineering practice
- Provide some documentation for the API
- Functionality to ignore:
  - User registration: a user should be created as soon as they post
  their first message
  - User authentication
  - Frontend (focus on the API only)
  - Data storage: storing everything in memory is fine

## Submitting

Place your code in a separate repo on https://github.com.
